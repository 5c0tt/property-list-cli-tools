Sean is not a human, he is a "gurmetilldadeltasarus", which by the way, breaks google if you search for it.  Bing also finds nothing, but manages to show you 170,000 result s for "gurmetilldadeltasarus"

If you were a time traveler, go forward one year and read this page, it should make more sense. 

This will be a readme.md file one day, open the code for now, and just download them and place them somewhere in your PATH and they should just work.
